### How to run the project:

#### Requirements:
* Java runtime installed
* Alternatively: Docker

#### How to play the game:
* Just download the SnakeGame.jar file
* Run it
* Start playing with the arrows keys
* If you lose, just close it and re-open it (I will add a restart button possibly)

#### How to run on Mac OSX with Docker:
* Install [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
* Launch XQuartz. Under the XQuartz menu, select Preferences
* Go to the security tab and ensure "Allow connections from network clients" is checked.
* In XQuartz terminal: Run xhost + ${hostname} to allow connections to the macOS host *
* run ```sudo docker-compose up --build```

#### Troubleshooting (No X11 DISPLAY variable was set):
* If on linux make sure you don't have a headless version of Java installed
* Otherwise check to make sure display environment variable is set
```
export DISPLAY=:0.0
```
